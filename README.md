A typical project to show how to write functions in different files and import all of them to index

Functions will be written in `Typescript` and as usual they are compiled to `JavaScript` before deployment.

Path to `TypeScript` files is `functions\src\...`
Path to `JavaScript` files is `functions\lib\...`

camelCase is used for file naming.
